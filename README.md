# Deep-Lemon

This is an excuse to use some deeplearn-js and see how far I can go...

### TODO

- [ ] Learn deeplearn.js
- [ ] Transform the checkpoints from the project to deeplearn
- [ ] Visualize the auto-encoder in the html (without doing the WCT)
- [ ] Apply whitening and check the results like in the paper
- [ ] Apply colorization and check the results in the paper
- [ ] Integrate all the code... and hopefully check that everything works
- [ ] yeah... it didn't work at first, check and fix every stupid error!

### Notes

- Paper: [Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08086.pdf)
